edited.csv is an edited version of raw.csv, where useless columns (fields) and incomplete raws (each raw correspond to one participant) have been deleted.

All data of interest is in edited.csv.

But to get the meaning of the columns, please have a look at raw.csv.

complex1: scaler values for the first session, when it shows the complex version.
simple1: scaler values for the first session, when it shows the simple version.
complex2: scaler values for the second session, when it shows the complex version.
simple2: scaler values for the second session, when it shows the simple version.

For instance:
"215.18 4 M;653.02 3 51;"
One rating at t = 215.18 s, with scaler set to 4 (I donâ€™t know what the third value M means)
A second rating at t = 653.02 s, with scaler set to 3
